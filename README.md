# ETF Analyzer

This Jupyter notebook provides an analysis of ETF returns data stored in an SQL database.

Specifically, it provides:
* An analysis of PYPL (which is a single asset in the ETF), including a DataFrame created from an SQL query of ETF database data, as well as interactive plots of daily and cumulative returns.
* DataFrames of PYPL data created from more advanced SQL queries to optimize the data access of the database.
* An analysis of all holdings in the ETF taken together, again including a DataFrame created from an SQL query and interactive plots.

The analysis can also be deployed as a web application as well.
